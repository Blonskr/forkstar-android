ForkStar

A fully decentralized communication software that supports end-to-end encryption, is resistant to censorship, completely anonymous, does not rely on any centralized servers, and ensures true security and freedom.

Core Advantages
We aspire to freedom and are grateful for the support of all open-source pioneers. ForkStar is now a place where we can freely exchange ideas on mathematics and technology.

Decentralization: Unlike traditional IM applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat, ForkStar does not rely on any centralized servers. Users have the freedom to choose their own mail servers or even set up their own, preventing censorship or blocking by any country or organization.
End-to-End Encryption: Utilizing PGP encryption, all messages can only be read by the sender and recipient, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
Fully Open Source: All source code is publicly available, allowing for global security audits to eliminate any potential backdoors.
Simple & User-Friendly: Adding friends is as easy as scanning a QR code, making it effortless to establish secure communication.

The Purpose of ForkStar

ForkStar exists to provide a decentralized and anonymous early-stage developer group communication tool for the development of MailCoin, and it will serve as the foundation for the future MailCoin client. Therefore, we would like to express our special thanks to the DeltaChat team for their contributions.

In the future, MailCoin will exist in two client forms:
	1.	IM-Based Client – A communication tool-based MailCoin client, focusing on decentralized, secure encrypted communication and transactions.
	2.	Traditional Email Client – Compatible with existing email clients, enabling a seamless encrypted cryptocurrency transaction experience.

This approach ensures that MailCoin maintains its decentralized nature while expanding its use cases and enhancing the user experience.
